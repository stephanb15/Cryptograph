**Cryptograph** is the name for a messenger-application which we (the author team) intended to build for testing some Cryptographic algorithms. These underlying algorithms were implemented by us.  Whereby we must mention, that they are based on some Mathematical textbooks (we took the Definitions of RSA, etc. from there).

***
Using **Python (3)** our Application can be build on different platforms (here: Operation Systems) such as **Linux**, **Windows**, **macOS**.

## modules
The following imported modules were of core interest:
* Tkinter -Lightweight, multi-platform support
* http.client, http.server - using SimpleHTTPRequestHandler 

## Download & Build
Cryptograph can explicitly be downloaded from Github: \
`git clone https://github.com/stephanb15/Cryptograph.git` \
For building the Cryptograph Apllication type the following commands \
### Linux:
`sh BUILD.sh`
### Windows & Mac
There is no build command available, you will have to adapt this on your own, if you like. \
Or go in the `Cryptograph` directory and enter; \
`python3 cryptograph.py` (as always).

## Getting Started
In the directory (left-) double-click the executable \
(put the executable name here)
If Using the GUI is not-trivial for you, have a look at
[GUI](https://github.com/stephanb15/Cryptograph/wiki/GUI)
So assuming you could login, what you will see is a window like this

1. Click on the top Left Template which lists your User-Name.
2. Click on the button text-field and start writing on your keyboard after the cursor starts blinking
3. Click (only once, left-mouse key) on the buttom-left button.

If now not only your message gets printed in the top-right text-field. But after up to 5 seconds the message is automatically reprinted in the text-field, you have successfully communicated with the server
